LumenForgeServer powers LumenForge, an inventory and rental platform built for small and
medium-sized organizations in the event industry. It helps teams keep track of their
equipment, organize vendor and category information, and manage maintenance states so
rentals and event prep stay reliable. The server provides the backend needed to keep
stock, availability, and operational details in one place for day-to-day work.
